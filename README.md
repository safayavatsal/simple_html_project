# CI/CD Pipeline with Bash, Python, and Cron Jobs

This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline setup using Bash, Python, and cron jobs on macOS with Nginx managed by Homebrew.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Simple HTML project.
- `check_commits.py`: Python script to check for new commits.
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment script to update the Nginx server.
- `latest_commit_sha.txt`: File to store the latest commit SHA.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up a Simple HTML Project

1. Create a simple HTML file:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>CI-CD Pipeline</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Initialize a Git repository and push to GitHub.

### Task 2: Set Up Local Nginx Instance on macOS using zsh Terminal

1. Install Homebrew (if not already installed).
2. Install Nginx using Homebrew with `brew install nginx`.
3. Start Nginx with `sudo brew services start nginx`.
4. Stop Nginx (if needed) with `sudo brew services stop nginx`.
5. Restart Nginx with `sudo brew services restart nginx`.

### Task 3: Write a Python Script to Check for New Commits

1. Create `check_commits.py` to check for new commits using the GitHub API.

### Task 4: Write a zsh Script to Deploy the Code

1. Create `deploy.sh` to clone the latest code and restart Nginx.

### Task 5: Set Up a Cron Job to Run the Python Script

1. Create a cron job to run `check_commits.py` every minute.

### Task 6: Test the Setup

1. Make a new commit and verify the changes are automatically deployed.
2. Check if Nginx is Running with `brew services list`.
3. Start Nginx Server (If Nginx is not running).
4. Restart Nginx Server (useful if you've made configuration changes or deployed new code).
5. Before restarting or starting the Nginx server, itâ€™s a good practice to check if there are any syntax errors in the Nginx configuration files using `sudo nginx -t`. This command will test the configuration and report any errors.
6. To diagnose issues or check what Nginx is doing, you can view the logs. The default log locations are:

## Access Logs:
    `tail -f /usr/local/var/log/nginx/access.log`

## Error Logs:
`tail -f /usr/local/var/log/nginx/error.log`

The `tail -f` command will continuously display new log entries, which is useful for real-time monitoring.

7. After deploying your HTML project, you can access it via your web browser. Assuming the default configuration and that your files are in /usr/local/var/www/, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8080`
